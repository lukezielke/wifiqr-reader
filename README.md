# wifiqr-reader
Extracts Wifi Name and Password from a QR Code.
So far only tested with Android generated Wifi QR Codes(Google Pixel, Android 14).

## Usage
Only .png and .jpg files are supported currently. The QR Code will automatically be found in the Image so you can upload full Screenshots/Images and don't have to cut out anything by yourself.
```
main.py <path_to_file>
```
